# retro-stockexchange

## Introduction 

In 2007 at university we had a little assignment to explore in a basic manner banks / stock exchanges.
We could choose to do this in every language. As I haven't used C++ in a project till then, I chose that language to learn.

We had to implement our own protocol for communication between the Client App, the Bank App and the StockExchange App.
My communication went through raw TCP/IP.

The project consist of 3 seperate applications:

- Bank: Store the users money
- StockExchange: Buy Stocks for users
- Client: Buy stocks with money stored in the bank
